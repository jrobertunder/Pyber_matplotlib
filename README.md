Ride share analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
It is clear that the most rides are generated in the suburban environment.  While urban and rural areas come in second and third respectively.
It is no surprise therefore that the most revenue is generated in the suburban environment. Refer to the two charts to see the actual results.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1) Group drivers by geographic location. I.E. drivers who live in suburban areas should receive priority over those who come in from urban or rural areas, 
    there will still be more than enough rides to go around.
2) Pool drivers by time slots.  More drivers are needed in the morning and evening hours while mid day slots are not crowded.
3) lower rates for rides during peak hours while keeping the rates for rides during the mid day slump at the normal rate.
